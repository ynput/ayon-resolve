"""This script is used as a startup script in Resolve through a .scriptlib file

It triggers directly after the launch of Resolve and it's recommended to keep
it optimized for fast performance since the Resolve UI is actually interactive
while this is running. As such, there's nothing ensuring the user isn't
continuing manually before any of the logic here runs. As such we also try
to delay any imports as much as possible.

This code runs in a separate process to the main Resolve process.
