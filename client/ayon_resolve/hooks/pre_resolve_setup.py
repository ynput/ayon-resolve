    """
    This hook will set up the Resolve scripting environment as described in
    Resolve's documentation found with the installed application at
    {resolve}/Support/Developer/Scripting/README.txt

    Prepares the following environment variables:
    - `RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API`
    - `RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB`

    It adds $RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules to PYTHONPATH.

    Additionally it sets up the Python home for Python 3 based on the
    RESOLVE_PYTHON3_HOME in the environment (usually defined in OpenPype's
    Application environment for Resolve by the admin). For this it sets
    PYTHONHOME and PATH variables.

    It also defines:
    - `RESOLVE_UTILITY_SCRIPTS_DIR`: Destination directory for OpenPype
        Fusion scripts to be copied to for Resolve to pick them up.
    - `OPENPYPE_LOG_NO_COLORS` to True to ensure OP doesn't try to
        use logging with terminal colors as it fails in Resolve.
